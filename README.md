# Time-Series-Prediction
In this project, the ARIMA model is trained on the Tata dataset, where daily stock prices
are used to forecast future values. After data preprocessing and train-test split, the ARIMA
model predicts stock prices for the testing period. The Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
metric is employed to evaluate the forecasting accuracy, and the results are presented
through a visual representation of the actual and predicted stock prices. The implementation
of the ARIMA model on the Tata dataset showcases the power of time series forecasting in
capturing underlying trends and patterns. The ARIMA model serves as a valuable tool for
analysts, researchers, and decision-makers seeking reliable predictions in time-dependent
datasets.
